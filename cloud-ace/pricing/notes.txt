first part

#put empty gray boxes instead of 3 images (just in case also put the img src, maybe not enough time)
#for the 3 circles, make them consistent with the blue theme color
#put the last 3 make sure of the template but comment out (the one that has link)
#style: when mouse-over the box, they got the shadows, and separated from each other


second part, very important, contains plan

#minus margin for the image? probably
#for image, use the image from the japanese website as is
#try make the image scroll-able (because the size is too large) overflow x auto , or other good ideas for the mobile site
#make the most expensive one stands out?
#scroll might make it NOT noticable in the first look -> try put a rounded corner or any noticeable corner style (maybe padding)
#collapse style column (only scroll able on the right side)
#light blue and white stripe table
#remove outer border of the table
#or, worst case, put the plans in a rows
