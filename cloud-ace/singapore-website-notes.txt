#Singapore website notes

#smaller window problems
-> The text hits other text when the window is smaller(Companies who moved to the cloud with Cloud Ace)
-> So does the images (meet the team)

Take notes on the main style
(to make it easier to edit in the future)
-> Website color template: text color, background
-> text size, header size, box size,
-> font-family: 'Roboto'
-> line height?
-> usage of hex color or text e.g. 'black' 'white'
-> no main container? -> the possibility to use flex box for smaller window
-> @media (media queries) option window sizes
