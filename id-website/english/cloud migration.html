<div class="cloud-migration-key-benefits-description">One of the biggest driving factors for companies to move their IT infrastructure to the cloud are cost savings. In fact, companies save 35% on average by moving to Google Cloud.</div>
<div class="cloud-migration-key-benefits-description">On the computing site of things, the reality often shows that many companies using on-premise have unused computing capacities that cost money to maintain. By using the clouds computing power with rightsized VM's that automatically scale up and down depending on your usage and paying for only what you actually consume, you can cut a lot of costs.</div>
<div class="cloud-migration-key-benefits-description">The same goes for data storage as well. By using dedicated storage options depending on the data type and required availability you can achieve high cost-efficiency and save a lot of storage costs.</div>

<div class="cloud-migration-key-benefits-description">When it comes to storing sensitive data on the cloud, security is a common concern. However, with Google Cloud your data is most likely safer than on private data servers, that are prone to hacker attacks and technical issues.</div>
<div class="cloud-migration-key-benefits-description">With Google Cloud your data is securely stored using multiple encryptions. Google complies to many international security standards and makes sure that your data is your data and no one else can access it, no matter what. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/">Click here</a> to learn more.</div>

<h1>Migration Methods</h1>
<div class="migration-methods-container">
<div class="migration-methods">
<div class="migration-methods-title">Lift and Shift</div>
<div class="migration-methods-description">With this method you simply move your current infrastructure to the cloud as it is by creating VMs that give you the exact same environment.</div>
<div class="migration-methods-description">This method is recommended when you want to migrate quickly and can't optimize you applications for the cloud, often the case with legacy applications.</div>
</div>
<div class="migration-methods">
<div class="migration-methods-title">Move and Improve</div>
<div class="migration-methods-description">With this method you also migrate your application as it is but afterwards you optimize is to run more efficiently on the cloud as well as adding features which take advantage of cloud services to make your application more functional.</div>
<div class="migration-methods-description">This method is usually a good compromise between migration time and result.</div>
</div>
<div class="migration-methods">
<div class="migration-methods-title">Rebuild on the Cloud</div>
<div class="migration-methods-description">With this method instead of moving your application, you rebuild it on the cloud setting up  a cloud-native architecture with serverless tools.</div>
<div class="migration-methods-description">This has a lot of benefits as it gives the most efficient and overall best result. If you want your application to be flexible and future-proof then this is the recommenced method.</div>
