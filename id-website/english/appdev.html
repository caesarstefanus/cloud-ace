<div class="application-development-description">One of the biggest driving factors for companies to develop system and application architectures and run them on the cloud is the scalability of the resources and flexibility that comes with it. Systems and applications these days have to work with a lot more data and traffic than ever before and downtime caused by traffic spikes can cost companies large sums of money.</div>
<div class="application-development-description">Studies show that over 80% of all companies are realizing that on-premise systems are not viable anymore and are using cloud based solutions or are planning to take advantage of cloud in the next few years. Google Cloud Platform has an infrastructure that can handle any amount of data, provide hight availability and up/down-scaling within seconds that traditional on-premise systems can never achieve.</div>

<div class="application-development-description">It is no secret that business are more successful when they focus on their core business. Maintaining an IT infrastructure can be burden that slows down your business development and can potentially cost you time and money.</div>
<div class="application-development-description">Google Cloud Platform offers a lot of managed services which let you focus and on your business instead of infrastructure. With build in serverless application building tools, auto-scaling, automatic resource and traffic management you can focus on building your systems or applications functionality and leave the backend up to Google.</div>

<div class="application-development-description">Google Cloud Platform gives you a lot of options to make sure that whatever you build is future-proof. Uptime and reliability for example can be crucial factors for success. With Google Cloud Platform you can safely deploy new features, updates and perform other changes at any given time as the system or application is running without downtime.</div>
<div class="application-development-description">In recent years containerisation and orchestration are becoming popular ways to assure flexibility, reliability while having options do deploy new versions in daily cycles. This can easily be done with Kubernetes, the biggest and most powerful service out on the market. And the best thing is, Kubernetes is directly integrated into Google Cloud Platform.</div>

<div class="application-development-serverless-benefits-description">
    Applications and systems running on the cloud profit from automatic resource provisioning and auto-scaling together with pay-per-use pricing, so you only pay for the resources you are actually using at any given time reducing costs tremendously. Even more so if they are build on the cloud from the start.</div>
