<h1>Powerful tools</h1>
<div class="big-data-description">If you want to work with big data and make the most out of it, not only do you need the right infrastructure but also the right tools for the job. For data analytics that is Google's BigQuery. Let's look at an example which demonstrates just how powerful BigQuery is and compare it to on-premise.</div>
<blockquote>[...] BigQuery can provide a three-year TCO (total cost of ownership) that is 26-34% lower than the other three cloud-based solutions (AWS, Azure &amp; Snowflake).
